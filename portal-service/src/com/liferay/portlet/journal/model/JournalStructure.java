/**
 * The model interface for the JournalStructure service. Represents a row in the &quot;JournalStructure&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.liferay.portlet.journal.model.impl.JournalStructureImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a journal structure model instance should use the {@link JournalStructure} interface instead.
